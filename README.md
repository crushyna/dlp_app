Data Localization Processing Application

DLP App is a small Python application based on Typer library that can help you dealing with either text or Excel price lists coming from various sources.
Idea for this application is to provide maximum automation and less manual work when dealing with each end every price list.

Key features:

Easy to use: available through command line interface, and takes only two arguments to run!
Multi-platform: can be run on every workstation equipped with Python 3.8+ (available to download here).
Fast: some of the price lists can be processed even under one second!
Grow large: due to being Python / CLI - based application (instead of desktop) it can be scaled to and implemented in future automation processes.
